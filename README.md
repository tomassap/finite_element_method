# finite_element_method
This collection of Matlab scripts & functions was developed in conjunction with a research project on the Finite Element Method 
applied to solving differential equations with general Dirichlet boundary conditions in the form of the Poisson equation.

I have also included my research paper as a pdf, typeset in Latex, which includes an analysis of my results consisting of L2 error
& order of convergence for the finite element method.
